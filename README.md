# Tune-Critic

I decided to take on a project that would teach me the basics of full stack development. This music review web application uses a django database utilizing postgresql for the backend and react for the front end.
The app lets a user register and login to an account where they can then create a personalized list of songs with their own ratings and opinion.

### Things I learned

- The workflow and cohesion between frontend and backend development
- Using JWT authentication tokens to verify a user's username, password and session by keeping track of refresh and access tokens on protected routes
- Applying the Spotify API to create a search function that accesses the platform's music database
- How Django's REST framework is used to respond to user post and get requests
